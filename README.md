# Ungsvify

## What is this?

Google Street View offers great on-the-ground images of places all over the world. These images are often times useful for presentations or analysis. However, their UI takes up a lot of real estate, even when minimized. Ungsvify (Un-Google Street Viewify...I know...) and its accompanying bookmarklet remove some of the UI elements that can get in the way of seeing the full images in Google Street View.

## How to use

### Use ungsvify.js from the Chrome console

1. Open up your console (F12)
2. Click on the **Sources** tab.
3. On the left side of your console is the Navigator pane. In the Navigator pane, click the **Snippets** tab.
4. Right-click in the **Snippets** area of the Navigator pane and select **New**.
5. Name your snippet `Ungsvify` or something you'll easily remember.
6. A new snippet will open. Copy and paste the ungsvify.js code into it.
7. Save your snippet (ctrl/cmd + s).
8. In your browser, go to Google Street View scene.
9. Back in your console, right-click your snippet in the Navigator pane and select **Run**

Tada! Hopefully your Google Street View scene should be a bit cleare without all that UI!

### Use ungsvify-bookmarklet.js

1. In your browser, create a new boomark.
2. Give it some title.
3. For the URL, copy and paste all the code in ungsvify-bookmarklet.js
4. Add the bookmark to your bookmarks bar if you'd like quick access.
5. Go to Google Street View.
6. Click your bookmarklet.

Hooray! Those nasty UI elements should be gone :)
